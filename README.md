Summary: This is a critical time for Pewlett-Hackard to focus on hiring, with 72,458 employees nearing retirement Pewlett-Hackard does not want to be short staffed. There are 1,549 employees eligible to be mentors, while this is a good start, there is still a shortage compared to the number of mentees there will be. One suggestion would be to have multiple mentees per mentor and to treat the mentorship program as a team effort, with mentor/mentee leadership as well as peer-to-peer collaboration.
